## Cucumber
Cucumber is a software testing tool that is used for behavior-driven development (BDD). It allows developers and stakeholders to collaborate on a shared understanding of the project requirements, by writing tests in a language that is easy to understand by all parties involved,Cucumber helps in improving communication and collaboration between different stakeholders involved in the software development process. It also helps in reducing the ambiguity in the requirements and ensures that the software is developed as per the desired behavior.
In Cucumber, a feature file and a step definition file are two important components used to create and execute BDD tests.

### Feature file:
A feature file is a plain text file that defines the behavior of an application in a specific scenario. It describes the expected behavior of the software in a business-readable language that can be understood by all stakeholders. A feature file typically contains a list of scenarios, each of which is composed of one or more steps. The feature file is written in the Gherkin language, which is a structured format that uses keywords such as Given, When, Then, And, and But.

### Step definition:
A step definition file is a code file that contains the implementation of the steps defined in the feature file. It maps the steps to the code that executes them. The step definition file is written in a programming language such as Java, Ruby, or JavaScript. Each step definition corresponds to a step in the feature file, and it contains the code that executes the corresponding action. The step definition file can be used to perform actions such as clicking buttons, filling out forms, and verifying the results of the tests.
